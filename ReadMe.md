& can also refer timestamp 121 geomaps area.

> #### Issues !!
- [ ] when user types long string without spaces in textbox the textbox overflows when we view it in pop up.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1731190/check-if-a-string-has-white-space
- [ ] Need to address the situation where user type space, tabs etc in the textbox https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1172206/how-to-check-if-a-text-is-all-white-space-characters-in-client-side/1173854
- [x] Multipart boundry not found while sending image in body to backend.
- [x] Getting Default lat long cordinates details via reverse geocoding even after providing the cordinates of the double click location by the user. Solved: had to make a seperate call to the api and then resolve promise for the async call.
- [x] the textarea Description field is not sending the the autofill data to the DB. solved: passed the location description prop directly to the data that is posted to the DB.
