***

> #### Refactoring  Options

- [ ] mongoose geojson https://mongoosejs.com/docs/geojson.html
& can also refer timestamp 121 geomaps area.

> #### Issues !!
- [ ] image upload via backend not completed yet , the object imagesStringArray gets destroyed when it reaches backend.
- [ ] when user types long string without spaces in textbox the textbox overflows when we view it in pop up.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1731190/check-if-a-string-has-white-space
- [ ] Need to address the situation where user type space, tabs etc in the textbox https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1172206/how-to-check-if-a-text-is-all-white-space-characters-in-client-side/1173854
- [x] logentries.map, Operation `logsentries.find()` buffering timed out after 10000ms is not a function sometimes Mongoose throws error buffering timed out need to handle the error to avoid the breaking of the entire application.Solution applied rate limiter for the post request of new travel entry via express-rate-limiter per IP can now request after 10 seconds delay only once.
- [x] transpilation issue by babel in react with mapboxgl due to incompatibility of react-mab-gl with babel/webpack resolved by explicitly mentioning to not transpile that bundle that caused error and instead use worker loader to transpile that error causing bundle.
refer:https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/10173
- [x] Multipart boundry not found while sending image in body to backend. Solved: just remove the headers part where u mention content-type:multipart/formData
- [x] Getting Default lat long cordinates details via reverse geocoding even after providing the cordinates of the double click location by the user. Solved: had to make a seperate call to the api and then resolve promise for the async call.
- [x] the textarea Description field is not sending the the autofill data to the DB. solved: passed the location description prop directly to the data that is posted to the DB.
