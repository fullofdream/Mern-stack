> React Native

- Their are two ways to build react native apps
  - [x] Expo CLI (set of tools and framework on top of react native hiding a lot of complexity)
  - [x] React Native CLI (for people with prior experience in mobile development, as this approach offers lot of extra flexibilty and customize or tweak native components one can eject from expo and use the underlying React native cli)
